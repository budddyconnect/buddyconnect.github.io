                <h1> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About Us </h1>
                <p style="text-align: left;">College Station is a home to thousands of Aggies. While a portion of them belong to the U.S and have family in and around, remaining would be those who had to travel thousands of miles from home to aspire their ambition in a new country. Despite being excited about starting the new phase in a new country, their minds will be stuffed up with thoughts on how to get started in the new place without any prior experience and suggestions. Buddy Connect aims at connecting all Aggies with their fellow mates thus helping everyone to get acclimatized to Aggieland and experience its rich culture. It will serve as a platform where freshers can get loads of information about the university and on how they can get settled to the student life within first few months of their start. They can simply browse through a variety of useful information like banking, bus routes, grocery shopping, restaurants, on-campus facilities, housing, tutoring, clubs, activities would be collaborated within this single application. As a critical feature, Aggies get to connect with buddies/mentors of their respective departments to gain help and knowledge about the course, department and of course, Aggieland experience. To create fun memories, Aggies can get to participate in events organized by certain event organizers and the buddies. With these features and an easy-to-use interface, Buddy Connect is assured to make the experience of Aggies in Aggieland a memorable one.</p>
